# Sample projects overview

## C++ projects
### Parallel A\* algorithm
Parallel A\* algorithm via MPI -- University of Trento HPC final project. PNBA\* and HDA\*, 2024 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deketver/HPC_A_star_parallel).

Implementation of PNBA\* algorithm as one of the possible approaches to parallelization of A\* algorithm.

### Qt Pexeso game
University final project -- desktop app for playing Pexeso game, 2021 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deketver/PexesoGame).

## Rust project
### Collection tool & Distribution robot
Team Rust project for Advanced Programming class -- University of Trento, 2024 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deketver/robotic_world_distribution_robot).

The whole topic of the course was the robotic world. Specifications defining how the robot's world should work and what it consists of were defined and unified across all teams.
My part in the project consisted of the Collection tool, which was made available for other teams to 'purchase'. This tool aimed to collect the desired Content
in the world if it met the user's specified criteria. The search was done via A\* algorithm and was therefore navigating the robot in the most energy-saving way.

Another part was an implementation of the Distribution robot (AI defining what the robot does in the world), which aimed to collect all Trees, Fish, and Rocks and distribute them equally into all available Markets in the world.
The distribution and which item belongs to which Market was done via an Evolutionary algorithm with the goal to minimize differences in the worth of different Markets. Each of the Contents
has its own value (similar to mass), which was defined in the world definition and also in the definition of the robot's score. This robot's behavior in the world maximizes the score.
Robot continues in the distribution of the Content until there is still any content to distribute in the world.

## Python projects

Most of the Python code, using ML and DL libraries (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Keras, Numpy), was created for a specific university classes at Charles University in Prague, and is not therefore covered in following listings.

### Testio
Testing Django framework for web application development, 2022 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deketver/Testio).

### Kiwi flight search
One of the first projects in Python, which was finding the best flight possibilities for given destination, 2022 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deketver/kiwi_project).

## Mix of languages
### Knowledge Graph - Trentino Weather Climate Change
Knowledge Graph Engineering course at University of Trento, final project, 2024 [Project pages](https://deketver.github.io/Trentino_weather_climate_change/).

## Java projects
### FridgeTracker
Small and quickly made FridgeTracker, which allows adding items to a virtual fridge in order to track dates of expiration. It allows search of the item via EAN code in the international database OpenFoodFacts, manual addition of an item, and scanning items from an invoice of a popular Czech groceries delivery service (Kosik, Rohlik), 2022 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deketver/FridgeTracker)
